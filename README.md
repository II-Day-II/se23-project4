Issue resolution

## Group 1:

- David Kaméus

- Håvard Alstadheim

- Alexander Binett

- Filippa Leuckfeld

- Carin Bystam

## Project

Name: Matplotlib

URL: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib

Fork URL: https://github.com/haval0/matplotlib

Matplotlib is a python library for creating graphs and plots easily.

## Onboarding experience

- Did you choose a new project or continue on the previous one?
    - We chose to stay with matplotlib as we didn't feel like we had the time to get into the structure of a new project.

- If you changed the project, how did your experience differ from before?
    - We didn't.

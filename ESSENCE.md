# Essence - Team

In what state are you in? Why? What are obstacles to reach the next state? How
have you improved during the course, and where is more improvement possible?

The team is currently in the Collaborating state. We passed the Seeded and
Formed states after we met and established our goals and
communication/collaboration channels. We are in the Collaborating state because
we have started to know each other and work cohesively and efficiently towards
our goal together, but are probably not yet in the Performing state because we
still experience some level of uncertainty and going through some trial and
error. With even more time and experience we would become familiar enough with
the work process to reach the Performing state.

During the course, our team has improved by getting to know each other better,
and knowing each other's strengths/weaknesses and work habits better. More
improvement is possible by further developing the routines and practices within
our team.
